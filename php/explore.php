				<h1>Explore</h1>
				<p>We hope you’ll take this opportunity to stay the weekend or longer and explore our little area of North Carolina and more. Here’s a handy map of places we recommend visiting in our neck of the woods.</p>

				<h2>Beyond Durham</h2>
				<p>With lower humidity and heat, October is a great time to bounce around the state and see what North Carolina is all about. Here’s some spots to consider if you’re up for road tripping:</p>
				<div class="faqs">
					<h3>Beaches</h3>
					<p>The Outer Banks are some very lovely beaches with good towns to boot. Our preferred location is Nags Head, a three hour drive from Durham. If you’re looking to go a bit closer, checkout Wilmington. The city is quite nice and has many nearby beaches as well.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>State Parks</h3>
					<p>Visiting state parks is a favorite fall pastime of ours. Close by to Durham are <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/pilot-mountain-state-park" target="_blank">Pilot Mountain</a> and <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/hanging-rock-state-park" target="_blank">Hanging Rock</a>, the former having cabins available to rent. Further out there’s <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/stone-mountain-state-park" target="_blank">Stone Mountain</a>, <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/grandfather-mountain-state-park" target="_blank">Grandfather Mountain</a>, <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/chimney-rock-state-park" target="_blank">Chimney Rock</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/mount-mitchell-state-park" target="_blank">Mt Mitchell</a>. </p>
					<hr>
					<h3>National Parks</h3>
					<p>The state parks are incredibly beautiful, but there’s a reason the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm" target="_blank">Smoky Mountains</a> is a National Park with its picturesque mountains and valleys. If you’re out this way, a ride along the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/blri/index.htm" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> is also a must.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Asheville</h3>
					<p>If city dwelling is more your speed, Asheville is city with a lot of charm with some of the best food and breweries in the state. The area is still recovering from the hurricane last year, but they’re ready for visitors. Close by Black Mountain is also worth a stop in.</p>
