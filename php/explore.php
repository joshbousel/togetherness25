				<h1>Explore</h1>
				<p>We hope you’ll take this opportunity to stay the weekend or make it an extended vacation to explore our little corner of North Carolina and beyond. Here’s a handy map of places we recommend visiting in our neck of the woods.</p>

				<h2>Beyond Durham</h2>
				<p>With lower heat and humidity, October’s shift in seasons is a great time to bounce around the state and see what North Carolina is all about. Here’re some spots to consider if you’re up for road tripping:</p>
				<div class="faqs">
					<h3>Beaches</h3>
					<p>The Outer Banks are some very lovely beaches with charming towns to boot. We’ve spent most of our time in Nags Head, about a 3-hour drive from Durham in and out of season. If you’re looking to go a bit closer, you may want to check out Wilmington — a fun port city with plenty of attractions and nearby public beach access.</p>

					<h3>State Parks</h3>
					<p>Visiting state parks is a favorite fall pastime of ours. Close by to Durham are <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/pilot-mountain-state-park" target="_blank">Pilot Mountain</a> and <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/hanging-rock-state-park" target="_blank">Hanging Rock</a>, the former having cabins available to rent. Further out there’s <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/stone-mountain-state-park" target="_blank">Stone Mountain</a>, <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/grandfather-mountain-state-park" target="_blank">Grandfather Mountain</a>, <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/chimney-rock-state-park" target="_blank">Chimney Rock</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/mount-mitchell-state-park" target="_blank">Mt Mitchell</a>. </p>
					<hr>
					<h3>National Parks</h3>
					<p>The state parks are incredibly beautiful, but there’s a reason the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm" target="_blank">Smoky Mountains</a> is a National Park with its picturesque mountains and valleys. If you’re out that way, a ride along the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/blri/index.htm" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> is also a must (just check which sections are currently open first).</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Asheville</h3>
					<p>If city dwelling is more your speed, Asheville is city with a lot of charm along with some of the best food and breweries in the state. The area is still recovering from last year’s hurricane, but they’re ready to welcome visitors. Nearby Black Mountain is also worth a stop in.</p>
