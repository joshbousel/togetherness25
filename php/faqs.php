					<h3>What is this?</h3>
					<p>Technically, this year marks 25 years of the two of us having partnered up. But really, this is about all of us! We may have hooked up with you since then, or maybe you’ve been with us for much longer. In any case &mdash; if, like us, you were just looking for an excuse to get together IRL and dance in a pre-fab box in the middle of nowhere, then LET THIS BE IT.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Can I bring the fam or a date?</h3>
					<p>Yup, partners, children, and plus ones are all welcome.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>What should I wear?</h3>
					<p>Whatever makes you feel comfortable and happy. This could be a good excuse to wear that thing you love that you never get to wear. If it helps, Kris will likely be wearing --- and Josh in casual cocktail attire with Adidas.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Gifts?</h3>
					<p>Your presence is a present!</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Can we hang outside of the party?</h3>
					<p>Of course! There’s an entire <a href="/playtime">extended weekend</a> of stuff planned from Friday through Monday, plus downtimes to just chill too.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Where should I stay?</h3>
					<p>We recommend staying in Durham since everything except the party will take place there. We have <a href="/stay">room blocks</a> at couple of hotels along with recommended Airbnbs to help you out. If there are no more hotel rooms left if our blocks, let us know and we’ll try to add more.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Do I need a car?</h3>
					<p>It would definitely be helpful, but not totally necessary. We can help arrange carpools and rideshares are plentiful in the area. We’ll also have a bus going to and from the party leaving from the Aloft Downtown Durham.</p>
					<p>If you plan on taking a rideshare to the party, we highly recommend arranging a car service or carpool to get back. (Chances of getting an Uber or Lyft from Pittsboro back to Durham may get a little dicey in the evening.)</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>What else should I do while I'm in North Carolina?</h3>
					<p>If you have the vacay or free time, the fall is a great season to explore North Carolina. Check the <a href="/explore">Explore page</a> for things to do in and around Durham, and there’s plentiful parks, mountains, and beaches within a couple hours drive too.</p>
