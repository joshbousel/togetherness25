					<h3>What is this?</h3>
					<p>Technically, this year marks 25 years of the two of us having partnered up. But really, this is about all of us! We may have hooked up with you since then, or maybe youâ€™ve been with us for much longer. In any case &mdash; if, like us, you were just looking for an excuse to get together IRL and dance <a href="/partytime">in an old hay pole barn</a> in the country, then LET THIS BE IT.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Can I bring the fam or a date?</h3>
					<p>Yup, partners, children, and plus ones are all welcome.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>There's someone else y'all know that would love to come, can I invite them?</h3>
					<p>Most likely yes, but we ask that you pls. check in w/us first (there are capacity limits at the venue that weâ€™ll have to take into consideration)</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>What should I wear?</h3>
					<p>Whatever makes you feel comfortable and happy. This could be a good excuse to wear that thing you love that you never get to wear. Whatever feels festive to you!</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Gifts?</h3>
					<p>Your presence is a present ðŸ™‚</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Can we hang outside of the party?</h3>
					<p>Of course! Weâ€™re planning on setting up a few more official meet-ups throughout the weekend. Keep an eye on <a href="/play">Letâ€™s play</a> for details.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Where should I stay?</h3>
					<p>We recommend staying in Durham since everything except the party will take place there. Check  <a href="/stay">Stay a while</a> for hotel blocks and some Airbnb recommendations. If there are no more hotel rooms left in our blocks, let us know and weâ€™ll see about adding add more.</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>Do I need a car?</h3>
					<p>It would probably be more convenient, but not totally necessary. We can help arrange carpools to the party, and rideshares are usually plentiful in the area. Weâ€™ll also likely have a bus going to and from the party if thereâ€™s enough interest. Be sure to let us know when you <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a> if this sounds like it might be for you!</p>
					<p>Quick reminder: If you plan on taking a rideshare to the party, we recommend arranging your return trip in advance. (Getting an Uber or Lyft from Cedar Grove back to Durham may be less reliable in the evening.)</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>What else should I do while I'm in North Carolina?</h3>
					<p>If you have the extra time, the fall is a great season to explore North Carolina. Check <a href="/explore">Explore</a> for things to do in and around Durham. Thereâ€™re plentiful parks, mountains, and beaches within a couple hours drive too.</p>
