				<h1>Let's play</h1>
				<p>Weâ€™re so excited to see yâ€™all and would love to spend time with everyone throughout the long weekend. Weâ€™re organizing a few meetups, but will also be down for ad hoc hangs Friday through Monday. If you think you may join for any of the below, please mark that youâ€™ll be there (you must be logged in to see the RSVP button) so we can plan accordingly ðŸ˜ŠÂ Canâ€™t wait!</p>

				<h2>Patio Karaoke + Pizza</h2>
				<h3>Fri Oct 10 @ 5:00pm</h3>
				<p>If you want the truest Josh+Kris Durham experience, join us in our backyard for an evening of patio karaoke with pizza and snacks. We'll be out as long as people are up for hanging out, but we'll probably need to go into quiet mode by around 10pm.</p>

				<h2>Morning River Hike on the Eno</h2>
				<h3>Sat Oct 11 @ 8:30am</h3>
				<p>Early risers unite for a hike along the Eno River. We'll start at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WvKQ61kYwADpWLTj7" target="_blank">main parking lot</a> at the <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/eno-river-state-park" target="_blank">Eno River State Park</a>, which is at the end of Cole Mill Road. From there it is a short bit of downhill to the river where you can choose to trek for just a little while or go for miles.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> Eno River State Park is currently closed due to the floods from tropical storm Chantal. If the park does not reopen before Oct 11, we'll choose a different location for this hike.

				<h2>Picnic Brunch</h2>
				<h3>Sun Oct 12 @ 10:30am-12:30pm</h3>
				<p>Join us for Sunday morning hangs in the park! Weâ€™ve reserved the picnic pavilion at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NNgZR7HDkFd4iVrQ9" target="_blank">Whippoorwill Park</a> in N. Durham and are planning to set it up with some light fare for sharing, but feel free to BYO brunch faves and other necessities. (Check this space again closer to the day to see what weâ€™ll be covering ðŸ™‚)</p>
