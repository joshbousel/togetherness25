				<h1>Let's play</h1>
				<p>We’re so excited to see y’all and would love to spend more time with everyone throughout the weekend. Hopefully, you can join us sometime!</p>
				<h2>Patio Karaoke + Pizza</h2>
				<h3>Fri Oct 10 @ 5:00pm</h3>
				<p>If you want the truest Josh+Kris Durham experience, join us in our backyard for an evening of patio karaoke with pizza and snacks. We'll be out as long as people are up for hanging out, but we'll probably need to go into quiet mode by around 10pm.</p>

				<h2>Morning River Hike on the Eno</h2>
				<h3>Sat Oct 11 @ 8:30am</h3>
				<p>Early risers unite for a hike along the Eno River. We'll start at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WvKQ61kYwADpWLTj7" target="_blank">main parking lot</a> at the <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/eno-river-state-park" target="_blank">Eno River State park</a>, which is at the end of Cole Mill Road. From there it is a short bit of downhill to the river where you can choose to trek for just a little while or go for miles.</p>
