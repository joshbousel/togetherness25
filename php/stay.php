				<h1>Stay a while</h1>
				<p>If you're traveling from out of town, we hope you'll stay the weekend, hang out, and explore Durham and beyond. Weâ€™ve put together a few options including room blocks at two Durham hotels and a collection of Airbnbs. Note: If the room blocks are sold out, please let us know and we'll see about adding more rooms.</p>
				<h2>Aloft</h2>
				<h3>$199/night + $15/night parking, must book by Sept 12</h3>
				<p>The Aloft is centrally located in downtown Durham where you can walk to most restaurants, bars, and venues. Rideshares are plentiful downtown, so if you donâ€™t plan on having a car, it will be a quick Uber/Lyft to get most places you want to go. The bus pick-up and drop-off for the party will be at the Aloft.</p>

				<h2>SpringHill Suites Durham Chapel Hill</h2>
				<h3>$149/night, must book by Sept 19</h3>
				<p>A more suburban setting with plenty of good food options nearby. About a 10-min drive to Chapel Hill/UNC, 15-min to downtown Durham, and about a half hour to Windy Hill Farm in Cedar Grove. Youâ€™ll probably want to have a car if you plan on staying here and want to explore the surrounding area. Useless fact: Once we were decided on leaving Queens for Durham, this is where we stayed when we came down on a weekend trip to find a place to live ðŸ™‚</p>

				<h2>Airbnb</h2>
				<p>If you have a larger crew or a home is more your vibe, thereâ€™re plenty of Airbnbs in the area. Weâ€™ve bookmarked a few in some of the more popular neighborhoods in town and in areas with proximity to both Durham and the party.</p>
				<p>Weâ€™d recommend staying in Durham if you want to be close to activities, but there are some nice options in and around North Durham, Chapel Hill and Hillsborough if a quiet weekend in the country is more your speed. (Note: You donâ€™t actually have to â€˜Joinâ€™ to view this Airbnb wishlist - simply â€˜Exitâ€™ the pop-up window to view.)</p>
