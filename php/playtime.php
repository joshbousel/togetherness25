				<h1>Playtime</h1>
				<p>We’re so excited to see y’all and hope to spend more time with everyone outside of the party too. We have some scheduled meet-ups you can join up with, and there’s downtime to just hang around too.</p>
				<h2>Patio Karaoke + Pizza</h2>
				<h3>Fri Oct 10 @ 5:00pm</h3>
				<p>If you want the truest Josh+Kris Durham experience, join us in our backyard for an evening of patio karaoke with pizza to enjoy alongside. We'll be out as long as people are up for hanging out, but we'll probably need to go into quiet mode around 10:00pm.</p>

				<h2>Morning River Hike on the Eno</h2>
				<h3>Sat Oct 11 @ 8:30am</h3>
				<p>Early risers unite for a hike along the Eno River. We'll start at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WvKQ61kYwADpWLTj7" target="_blank">main parking lot</a> at the <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/eno-river-state-park" target="_blank">Eno River State Park</a>, which is at the end of Cole Mill Road. From there is a short bit of downhill to the river where you can choose to trek for just a little while or for miles.</p>

				<h2>Central Park Picnic</h2>
				<h3>Sun Oct 12 @ 11:00am</h3>
				<p>Enjoy some post-party recovery time outside with a picnic lunch at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kGioacufcyU9U92CA" target=_blank">Durham Central Park</a>. This is a BYO affair and there's a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/o3xGimLZTh1p7HBUA" target="_blank">food hall</a> right on the park to grab eats, or a variety of nearby restaurants as well. Bring picnic blankets if you got 'em.</p>

				<h2>Happy Hour at Motorco</h2>
				<h3>Sun Oct 12 @ 4:00pm</h3>
				<p>Didya know that happy hour specials are illegal in North Carolina? That doesn't stop us from regularly gathering to enjoy some beers and eats together in the late afternoon. We'll meet up at our buddy Josh's spot <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/xpEVxi3DGHATYxJr8" target="_blank">Motorco/Parts & Labor</a> which has some good bites along with beer and other drinks.</p>

				<h2>Bowling</h2>
				<h3>Mon Oct 13 @ 12:00pm</h3>
				<p>Another useless fact for you, sometimes Kris subs on a bowling league. Despite our beloved old school alley closing a couple years ago, we still bowl at nearby <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Rq44rHGLWhkBXmWL8" target="_blank">Bowlero</a> and would like to enjoy a game or two if you're sticking around to make it a 3-day weekend. </p>
