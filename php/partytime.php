					<h2>Getting There</h2>
					<h3>Driving</h3>
					<p>The Plant is about a 40 minute drive from Downtown Durham and has plentiful parking. If you’ll be driving and are willing to carpool, you can let us know in your RSVP and we’ll coordinate from there.</p>
					<h3>Bus</h3>
					<p>For those who don’t have a car or just prefer not to drive, we’ll have a bus going to and from the party. The bus will depart promptly at 4:00pm from the the Aloft in Downtown Durham and will leave the party at 9:00pm. If you plan on taking the bus, please let us know in your RSVP so we can make sure we have adequate space for all who want.</p>
					<h3>Rideshares & Carpools</h3>
					<p>Getting to the venue via Uber/Lyft from Durham will not be a problem, but getting one back from the venue might be. If you plan on using a Rideshare service, we highly recommend prearranging a car service to bring you home or connect with us about coordinating a carpool.</p>
