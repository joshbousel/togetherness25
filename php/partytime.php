				<h2>Windy Hill Farm</h2>
				<p>Lovingly stewarded by the Gledhills since 1977, the family currently raises goats, tends bees, and grows blueberries in addition to welcoming all manner of celebrations on the farm. The land at Windy Hill has been continuously farmed from the early 1800s, if not longer. Mother and daughter duo Jane & Chiara continue the work and care of the farm in memory of their late husband and father, Geoffrey Earle Gledhill. They remain dedicated to sustainable farming practices, which benefit the environment, improve the health of the land, respect the lives of the animals and people who consume their products, conserve wild spaces, and preserve the history of the land.</p>
				<p>All dedicated event spaces on the farm are open-air. Most are partially, if not fully, shaded, and the main event pavilion features a few extras like cozy heaters, wind screens, and wall fans, but remember to dress for the weather!</p>
				<p>All are welcome to explore and enjoy the adjacent lawns, fire pit, gazebo, and goat pasture, in addition to the pavilion, for the duration of the party, so comfortable footwear is also recommended.</p>

					<h2>Getting There</h2>
					<h3>Driving</h3>
					<p>Windy Hill is about a 30-minute drive from downtown Durham. Attendants will be available upon your arrival to help direct parking along the gravel drive. There should be plenty of space for all, but if youâ€™ll be driving and are willing to carpool, please do let us know with your RSVP and we can help coordinate from there, if need be.</p>
					<p>We recommend using the address for directions because a wrong location shows up in Google Maps when searching for Windy Hill Farm alone.</p>
					<h3>Bus</h3>
					<p>We will have busses going to and from the farm. The busses will depart promptly at 4:30pm from the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6tdnKuMe8o6So5dv5" target="_blank">Aloft</a> in downtown Durham and will make the return trip at 9:00pm. If you plan on taking the bus, please let us know when you RSVP to reserve your spot. (No need to commit right this minute ðŸ™‚ You can always update your reply later and weâ€™ll be sure to send out reminders as we get closer to party time.)</p>
					<h3>Rideshares & Carpools</h3>
					<p>Getting to Cedar Grove from Durham and back again via Uber/Lyft shouldnâ€™t be an issue w/plenty of available drivers in Durham and nearby Hillsborough, but you may want to arrange your return ride in advance, just to be sure (options may start to dwindle as the evening progresses)!</p>
