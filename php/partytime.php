				<h2>The Plant</h2>
				<p>Once the site of the largest flower farm in the US, <em>Boardman’s Flower Farm</em>, aka <em>Sunshine Gardens</em>, specialized in growing “football” chrysanthemums, which it provided for JFK’s inauguration in 1961. <em>Inco Alloys</em> acquired the site in the 80s, turning it into a manufacturing plant producing metal alloys for marine, aircraft, and aerospace industries. In more recent years, it has served as a green industry incubator, kickstarting businesses that include Piedmont Biofarm, Screech Owl Greenhouses, and Eastern Carolina Organics, among others. Today, <a href="https://www.theplantnc.com/" target="_blank">The Plant</a> is a 17-acre eco-industrial park, home to several local businesses including a meadery, native plant nursery, brewery, art gallery, and more.</p>

					<h2>Getting There</h2>
					<h3>Driving</h3>
					<p>The Plant is about a 40-minute drive from downtown Durham and has plentiful parking throughout the campus. If you’ll be driving and are willing to carpool, be sure to let us know in your RSVP and we’ll coordinate from there.</p>
					<h3>Bus</h3>
					<p>For those who don’t have a car or just prefer not to drive, we’ll have a bus going to and from the party. The bus will depart promptly at 4:00pm from the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6tdnKuMe8o6So5dv5" target="_blank">Aloft</a> in downtown Durham and will return at 9:00pm. If you plan on taking the bus, please let us know in your RSVP to reserve your spot.</p>
					<h3>Rideshares & Carpools</h3>
					<p>Getting to the venue via Uber/Lyft from Durham shouldn’t be a problem, but getting a ride back from the venue might be. If you plan on using a rideshare service, we highly recommend prearranging a car service to bring you home or connect with us about coordinating a carpool.</p>
